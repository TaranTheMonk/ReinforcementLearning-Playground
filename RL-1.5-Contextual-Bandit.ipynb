    "## The Contextual Bandits\n",
    "### Here we define our contextual bandits. In this example, we are using three four-armed bandit. What this means is that each bandit has four arms that can be pulled. Each bandit has different success probabilities for each arm, and as such requires different actions to obtain the best result. The pullBandit function generates a random number from a normal distribution with a mean of 0. The lower the bandit number, the more likely a positive reward will be returned. We want our agent to learn to always choose the bandit-arm that will most often give a positive reward, depending on the Bandit presented."
